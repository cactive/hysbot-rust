# HypixelStatistics - Rust Implementation

Initial implementation of the HypixelStatistics Twitch bot in Rust from (pre. TypeScript).

### Running Locally

- You need to `export` the `TWITCH_TOKEN`, `LOGIN_NAME` and `HYPIXEL_API_KEY` environment variables.

- You can run and start using `cargo run` or `cargo build`, both producing an executable.

- The bot will automatically join your channel and respond to `-ping` and `-gu`.
